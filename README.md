**How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially 
consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect 
the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working 
in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?**

In order to create programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I use OOP to
create distinct files and functions for required purposes. As part of this, I create
well-named and commented code which explains its purpose. By working in this way, I was
able to take the code I created in Project One and adapt it to work with Plotly Dash,
instead of needing to create entirely new code for the dashboard. If I were to create
another similar dashboard, I could likely reuse my CRUD Python module as a great starting
point, and adapt it to whatever database I may be using at the time.

**How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the 
database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach 
to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or 
strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?**

I try to approach problems by first gaining a thorough understanding of the requirements, 
planning how these may be converted into code and executed, coding, testing, and finally 
delivering the result to the end user. This is generally how I approach problems regardless
of the course, with the difference being what materials I may need to study in order to
complete the work. In the future, to meet client requirements I will likely review how other
code in the company has been developed / delivered and build off of that, either asking
coworkers for insight or referring to third-party sources as necessary.

**What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type 
of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?**

Computer scientists are responsible for creating technology (generally through software) to
accomplish an almost endless list of tasks, generally to make the user's goal more easily
attainable, able to be accomplished, or more engaging. My work on a project such as this one
would allow a company like Grazioso Salvare to speed up their process of finding eligible
candidates for their tasks (in this case, finding eligible dogs to train for rescue operations).
